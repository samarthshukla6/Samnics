# Samnics - 3D Interactive Website

Samnics is an interactive 3D website built with modern web technologies such as Three.js, GSAP, ScrollMagic, and Blender models. The website incorporates 3D scenes, animations, and smooth scrolling effects, with Blender models compressed and optimized using the Draco pipeline for better performance.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Elements:** 3D components powered by Three.js, allowing smooth navigation and immersive experiences.
- **GSAP Animations:** High-performance animations implemented using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth and responsive transitions.
- **ScrollMagic Integration:** Scroll-triggered animations using ScrollMagic, creating an engaging parallax scrolling effect as users interact with the page.
- **Blender Models:** 3D models created in Blender, optimized for the web using the BLTG pipeline and encoded/decoded with Draco for better performance and smaller file sizes.
- **Draco Compression:** Draco compression technology is used to reduce the size of 3D models without compromising visual fidelity.

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **GSAP:** GreenSock Animation Platform for high-performance, complex animations.
- **ScrollMagic:** Library for creating scroll-based animations and parallax effects.
- **Draco Compression:** Efficient geometry compression for 3D models.
- **Blender:** 3D modeling and animation tool used to create assets.
